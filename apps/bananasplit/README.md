- Press the side **BUTTON** to quickly navigate back to the home screen.
- **RIGHT TAP** the watch _once_ to add a banana that **does not** fit in the container. **RIGHT TAP** the watch _twice_ to add a banana that **does** fit in the container.
- **LEFT TAP** the watch _once_ or _twice_ to remove bananas that have accidentally been added.
- **TWIST** the watch to shower bananas across the screen!
